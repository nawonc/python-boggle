# python-boggle
by Nawon Choi (nawonc)


This was my term project for 15-112, Fundamentals of Programming and Computer Science, an intro-level computer science course at Carnegie Mellon University.
It is a game based on the board game, “Boggle,” or the mobile app, "Word Streak."
It uses a plaintext file called “dictionary.txt” which is a list of all the words in the Scrabble dictionary.
The dictionary.txt file should be in the same folder as the python-boggle.py file.
It is written in Python 3 and uses Tkinter.
